## Data Cleaning and Preparation

Data cleaning is a critical step in ensuring the accuracy of our analysis. This project employs several techniques:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: We identify and fill or remove missing values based on their significance.
2. **Data Type Conversion**: Ensure all data types are correct for analysis (e.g., dates, categories).
3. **Outlier Detection**: Identify and handle outliers that may skew results.
4. **Normalization**: Standardize data formats for consistency.

The cleaned data is then used to generate the visualizations in Tableau.
